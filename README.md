## Notes for Project Part 3

Ben:

Inflated Contribution Numbers:
1. I initialized the android studio project with 800+ lines. [48cac910d4dba75b2b1bb38b852967ba53ecd60a](https://github.com/CMPUT301W21T12/FAANG-GANG/commit/48cac910d4dba75b2b1bb38b852967ba53ecd60a).
2. I may have accidentally done weird merges, in commit [d6ae03d5c6bf1c99c13c49ffa490f9128bb8a3ee](https://github.com/CMPUT301W21T12/FAANG-GANG/commit/d6ae03d5c6bf1c99c13c49ffa490f9128bb8a3ee).
* This would cause my contribution count to be inflated because it marked me as having written parts of other people's code even though I did not.
